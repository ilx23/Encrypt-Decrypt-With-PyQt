## Introduction:

Welcome to the Encrypt Decrypt With PyQt5 project! This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using various cryptographic algorithms. Users can input text, choose an encryption algorithm, and perform encryption or decryption operations easily.

## Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI offers an intuitive interface for users to input text and select encryption algorithms.

2. **Encryption and Decryption:** Users can encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext using different cryptographic algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA.

3. **Secure Encryption:** The application ensures secure encryption by implementing standard cryptographic algorithms.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
> ```git clone https://github.com/ilx23/Encrypt-Decrypt-With-PyQt5.git```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install PyQt5 and cryptography libraries. You can install them using pip:
> ```pip install PyQt5```

3. **Run the Application:** Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
> ```python app.py```

4. **Input Text:** Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt into the input field.

5. **Select Algorithm:** Choose the encryption or decryption algorithm from the dropdown menu.

6. **Perform Operation:** Click on the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the corresponding operation.

7. **View Result:** The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed on the screen.
